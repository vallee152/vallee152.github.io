						<h2 align="center">Introduction (About Me)</h2>
						<br>
						<p>Hello, I am Valley/Val, my friends call me Jeb (<a href="./tok.html">toki pona</a> la, mi jan Wali). I am just some random Canadian on the internet. You may want to check out my other <a href="#socials">social media</a>. I like videos, gaming, chatting, browsing, furries UwU, random trivia, my SO, and a whole lot of other things. BTW, I'm not too familiar with HTML/CSS, so do keep that in mind if something looks broken on this site.</p>
						<p>Often at night, I have the most random thoughts. I write these thoughts down to look at again in the morning, when I'm able to think more clearly. Once I look them back over, I clean up the mess of words, and if I like what I see, I then set whatever it is to my status for a bit. If you want to see a list of what I have had in the past, click <a href="#quotes">here</a>. I like making them, it's a fun little project that I have going on that doesn't take that much effort. I would recommend other people to pick this up, who knows what you'll come up with? I hope someone actually ends up creating some big project from this, instead of just small quotes like mine.</p>
						<p>There are quite a few games that I've played. If you want to see a list of the games that I think are worth shouting out, check it out <a href="#games">here</a>. There are so many games I want to play, but haven't yet because I don't have the time with the priority. I want to know some how people can game twenty-five hours a day, eight days a week. Meh, I guess it just means that I have a life. Living the game called life is a whole different level... BTW you just lost The Game.</p>
						<p>I like to program. I typically use Visual Basic, since that's what my job has me use (Excel macros). I do know some other, high level languages like Batch, Python, and some JavaScript, but I don't use them as often. On the other end of the spectrum, I like to play around with Turing tarpits, such as Brainf*ck and some others that I've made myself. I haven't made any really big projects, only small programs or terminal-based games. Before you ask about it, no, my brain is too smol for any "real" languages, such as C.</p>
						<p>IDK where to put this other than here. This just contains a few forewarnings on how I am, so you can hopefully have some patience with me. I know that this doesn't excuse me from one of these behaviours, but I have been working on it, so who knows? I may end up being able to delete parts or all of this paragraph sooner or later (may end up adding things that I notice)... 1) I prefer to listen than to talk, but when I do get talking, I might not shut up. 2) I ask a lot of questions. 3) I can often find it difficult to express myself, for example this little auto-biography is months in the making, and it's just the intro part to the rest of this site. 4) I have some anger issues, when this occurs, I'll typically start trying to shut you out and I'll be writing in caps (excluding acronyms, I usually write those in caps regardless of my mood). The best way to stop this is to just ignore me, ghost me for a while, I might get angry that you'd just upped and left, but it's for the better. </p>
						<p>To help you see what my interests are in a different fashion, <a href="#images">these images</a> may help. Whenever I think of it, I'll add more and more images. The images could be for any topic, it can overlap with some other section on this webpage, it could be a hobby I didn't mention, it could be an image from my personal life, or it could be some random shitpost.</a>

								<p align="justify" class="parLeft">Ghosts aren't the most photogenic of beings, but when they do get photographed, they look spooktacular. Here you can see the soul of Valley, wandering in an undisclosed location. He doesn't look too pleased, so even if you knew the where to go, it would be highly recommended to not interact with him, especially by taking a picture. Legend has it that the one who took this photo is a ghost as well. Be wary, for you might be a ghost too!</p><hr>

With this image, though, you are looking through two of my lenses (one on the camera and one on the floor). Two negatives actually makes a negative confirmed?

IDC what the loud minority says, VRC is still a good game and I really enjoy it, especially when cuddling cuties.</p><hr>
