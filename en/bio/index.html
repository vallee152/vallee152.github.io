						<br>
						<p>Hello, I am Valley/Val, my friends call me Jeb (<a href="../../tok/lipu-mi/index.html">toki pona</a> la, mi jan Wali). I am just some random Canadian on the internet. You may want to check out my other <a href="../media/index.html">media</a> and my <a href="../blogs/projects.html">projects</a>. I like videos, gaming, chatting, browsing, furries UwU, random trivia, my SO, and a whole lot of other things. BTW, I'm not too familiar with HTML/CSS, so do keep that in mind if something looks broken on this site.</p>
						<p>There are quite a few games that I've played. If you want to see a list of the games that I think are worth shouting out, check it out <a href="../blogs/games.html">here</a>. There are so many games I want to play, but haven't yet because I don't have the energy. I want to know how some people can game twenty-five hours a day, eight days a week. Do they just drink energy drinks constantly? Anyway, games that I've been playing a lot of lately are VRChat, Minecraft, BeamNG.Drive, Half-Life, DiRT Rally, Cluster Truck, Virtual Circuitboard, and Micro Dash.</p>
						<p>I like to program. I typically use Visual Basic, since that's what my job has me use (Excel macros). I do know some other, high level languages like Batch, Python, JavaScript/Typescript, Arduino C, and probably a few others, but I don't use them as often. On the other end of the spectrum, I like to play around with Turing tarpits, such as Brainf*ck and some others that I've made myself. I know that you're not meant to choose favourites out of your children, but my favourite language, that I made, is <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Watnoxt">Watnoxt</a>. I haven't made any really big projects, only small programs and terminal-based games.</p>
						<p>To help you see what my interests are in a different fashion, <a href="../blogs/images.html">these images</a> may help. Whenever I think of it, I'll add more and more images. The images could be for any topic and it can overlap with other pages.</a></p>
